## Terminal IDE 42:
An ultra-efficient Neovim based IDE for Python and C/C++ prototyping.

### Why the name?

Tide42, formerly XTide86, is inspired in part by *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*, where "42" is famously revealed as the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. 

This project reflects that same spirit: a terminal IDE that encourages curiosity, simplicity, and discovery—*you ask the questions*. Tide42 is meant to be your solution, leaving the questions in your hands. 

# Tide42 NEWS:
06

-NOTICE FOR EXISTING USERS!! New --update logic is now fully functional and tested across multiple systems. You can either git restore . and git pull origin stable in your repo or re clone, chmod+x install.sh and ./install.sh; Use --update going forward.
06.11.25

⚠️ **PLEASE Back Up Your Configs!** ⚠️  
Tide42 installs `init.vim` to `~/.config/nvim`, which may overwrite `init.vim`/`init.lua`. Back up first! Run mv init.lua or init.vim to save configs to `~/.config/nvim/backup/*.bak`. This should now be handled by the installer but the best way is to do it manually before running the installer to be sure. Don’t lose your hard work!

07.28.25
-  Added new bindings for buffer manipulation and tweaked default ui layout"

07.26.25
- Added zsh logic for initialization of the terminal buffer. 
- The default shell is bash however users can comment the initialization buffer for bash starting at line 153 and ending at line 191 to switch to zsh if desired.

- Changed default ui to maximize the file buffer and minimize all other buffers for a cleaner entry. All buffer manipulation hotkeys remain the same.

06.09.25
- Tide42 tested and working on 32bit systems and on the newest nvim version 0.11.2
- Added autocmd for default colorscheme. Check lines 96 and 154 of init.vim to customize your own palette and theme like habamax, elflord, peachpuff, etc.

06.03.25
- Default input layout reformatted with latest push.. feedback requested or alternately change it to your liking in init.vim.
- If you are having issues with the ipython buffer closing when running instances of gui libraries like pygame, use the RestartIPython function with :RestartIPython or \n to create a new buffer. 
- WARNING!! If making your own modifications to tide42 make sure to back then up before running --update as it will wipe and copy over any existing changes in your repo or installed files including init.vim

If your repo is on main:
- cd ~/PATH/TO/REPO
- git fetch origin
- git restore .
- git checkout stable
- git pull origin stable
- chmod +x install.sh
- ./install.com
- All alias logic is handled by install.sh so that --update remains functional. Simply run xtide86 --update from anywhere and use either xtide86 or tide42 to launch.
- Added global `set noswapfile` to prevent swap creation on startup
- Re-enabled swapfile only for non-NERDTree buffers via BufWinEnter autocmd
- Eliminated rare `.swp` file generation in terminal sessions
- Optional: silently delete swapfiles via SwapExists to suppress flash warnings
- If you have not already done so, please run git pull within your repo directory, or simply re clone to update to the new stable release 1.2.0. Going forward, the method of updating will be to simply use the flag --update

**Version:** `v1.2.0`
>**New in v1.2.0:** - Functionality to yank text from any buffer (IPython, TermiC, Terminal) and append to file editor for easy notes.
> 
> - Lite mode with --lite to open tide42 with no tmux session for quick edits or low resource systems.
> - Improved color rendering in all panes and status bars
> - Toggle between classic **Portcullis** and modern **GRID** visual themes or medieval listchars in init.vim
> - Now supports opening new files editing files with tide42 followed by the filename
> - Use flag --quiet or -q to suppress log output.
> - Update tide42 from your anywhere with --update
> - Added keybinding \s to expand and select TermiC or \x to perform the same action for the terminal buffer.

## Additional NeoVim commands for ease of buffer management
##
`jk` = Command mode from nvim buffer
##
`:Hs` = Quick command for horizontal split

## Tips
##
- If you would like to map tide42 to a keyboard shortcut the best method is to use this command and substitute your terminal name: <gnome-terminal> -- bash -c "/usr/local/bin/tide42; exec bash"
- ggVG to select all when in nvim command mode followed by  \p or \l for efficient transfer of text into IPython or TermiC
- Once in insert mode in any ``nvim`` buffer, the recommended way of entering command mode is `jk` all other buffers will require `Esc`
- NERDTree may be refreshed with Shift+r after performing operations in the terminal buffer.
- All NeoVim commands can also be used in any other buffer. 
- Quickly enter focused and expanded file editor mode with Ctrl A/D (make sure you are in the correct tmux buffer), \z, \i <1000>
- Switch between tty sessions and retain tide42 session through tmux. Handy if connecting through SSH.
-If you're running tide42 inside a tmux or custom terminal session, you might run into issues when trying to save root-owned files from within Neovim:
Using commands like :w !sudo tee % in NeoVim may silently fail to prompt for a password and kick you out after 3 attempts.
Solutions:
Use a GUI editor instead within a tide42 terminal buffer to avoid leaving your session:
ex. sudoedit /etc/systemd/system/...
Launch a root nvim in a nested terminal within tide42:


## tide42 Remote SSH Session
##
Work remotely. Drop connection. Pick up exactly where you left off.
Instructions:
- ssh user@remotehost
- run tide42 and use any buffer for file transfers or processing.
- Do your work. Close the laptop. Disconnect. Go outside.
- ssh user@remotehost
- run tide42 to reconnect to tmux protected tide42 session.

## Features

- Full ``tmux`` and ``nvim`` '-powered terminal IDE with dynamic buffer management
- Seamless integration with ``IPython``
- ``TermiC`` support with quick pasting and testing C/C++ (smaller blocks recommended or lambda specific functions) see ``Termic`` 
  documentation at https://github.com/hanoglu/TermiC)
- Hotkey support for sending code directly into live interpreter sessions
- Single-interface fallback for simple edits
- Quick launch from Gnome via icon or keyboard shortcut
- Works in the tty as well as the terminal emulator

## Requirements

- ``tmux``
- ``neovim`` 0.9.0+ (tested on 0.9.5)
- ``vim-plug`` curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim 
- ``TermiC`` wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanoglu/TermiC/main/TermiC.sh"  (live C/C++ shell)
- ``Anaconda3`` with ``IPython`` (preferred, but may work with base ``IPython``)
- ``bash``
- Works on ARM. Tested on a Raspberry Pi5 and nvim 0.9.5 had to be built from source. Check your distro and dependencies on ARM. 

## Installation

# Preferred for updates:
:`bash`
- git clone https://github.com/logicmagix/tide42.git
- cd tide42

# Make the script executable (one-time setup)
- chmod +x install.sh
- ./install
- tide42 to start session

# If downloading .zip:
- Go to https://github.com/logicmagix/tide42 and click "Code" > "Download ZIP".
- Extract the ZIP to a directory (e.g., ~/tide42/).
- Run the installation script:
- cd ~/tide42/
- ./install.sh

## Updating tide42

# To update tide42 to the latest version, you must have a cloned Git repository.

- tide42 --update

## Notes:

- The sudo command may prompt for your password to modify /usr/local/bin.
- If you used a ZIP download, you cannot use tide42 --update unless you convert the directory to a Git repository.


## Usage
- Launch tide42 from your terminal or assigned launcher with tide42 or tide42 <FILENAME>. It will:

- Open a tmux session with vertically split nvim, TermiC, and IPython

- Send text from the file editor to the live interpreter buffer with ggVG(select all) \p for ipython and \l for TermiC

- Automatic insert mode and buffer sizing for paste to Termic and paste to IPython functions.

- Support session save (Ctrl+q+d) and reset with :Q

# Without tmux?
- Simply open nvim enjoy all the features without additional buffers and ctrl q + d, ctrl q + a, ctrl q + s, and ctrl q + d controls.

# Customization
- See init.vim for plugin configuration, UI tweaks, and terminal behavior.
Feel free to remix buffer sizes and colors to match your workflow.

# TermiC Support
- tide42 includes termic.sh, a lightweight live shell.
It installs automatically to /usr/local/bin/termic.
Licensed under GPLv3 and included with permission.
